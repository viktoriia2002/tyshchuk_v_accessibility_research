      <p><strong>Person 1 </strong>I'm gonna pop some tags
        Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
        I, I, I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
        This is fucking awesome</p>

      <p><strong>Person 2 </strong>Nah walk up to the club like, what up, I got a big cock!
        I'm just pumped, just bought some shit from the thrift shop
        Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty
        The people like, Damn! That's a cold ass honkey.
        Rollin' in, hella deep, headin' to the mezzanine
        Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
        Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me
        Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets
        (Piss)
        But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it) Coppin' it, washin' it
        'Bout to go and get some compliments
        Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in them
        Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stuntin' and flossin' and
        And savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch
        I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
        No for real ask your grandpa can I have his hand-me-downs?
        (Thank you) Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
        Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
        They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
        I bought a skeet blanket, and then I bought a kneeboard
        Hello, hello, my ace man, my Miller
        John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
        I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
        The sneaker heads would be like Aw, he got the Velcros
        </p>

        The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
        I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
        They be like, Oh, that Gucci. That's hella tight
        I'm like, Yo that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt
        Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
        Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch (Shit)
        I call that getting swindled and pimped (Shit)
        I call that getting tricked by a business
        That shirt's hella dope
        And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
