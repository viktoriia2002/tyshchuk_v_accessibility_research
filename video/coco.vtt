00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.860
Oh, it's you couldn't get me in trouble that
someone could hear me.

2
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.010
I wish someone wanted to hear me other than
you.

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.860
OK. I know I'm not supposed to love music,
no music, no music.

4
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.860
But my great grandma, Cukor's father, was
the greatest musician of all time, but it

5
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.160
needs to relax.

6
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.730
One day he left with his guitar and never
returned.

7
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.800
My family thinks music is a curse.

8
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.440
Great great grandfather.

9
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.530
None of them understand me.

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm supposed to play music, all right, who's
in there?

11
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.480
I'm sorry, what's going on?

12
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.500
Do you mind? No.

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.250
Welcome to the Land of the Dead.

14
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.820
You got to stay with me. Boy, this isn't a
change in your AurÃ©lio.

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.960
Agents at the Department of Family Reunions
are available to assist you.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.510
Please be on the lookout for a living we
gave you here.

17
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.500
We're your family, your.

18
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.080
I know your great great grandfather.

19
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.960
I'll get you to him. What are you doing?

20
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.590
I'm working like a skeleton.

21
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.130
No, skeletons don't work like that.

22
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.260
That's how you walk.

23
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.380
No, I don't. When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you, you disappear

24
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.320
from this world, but you can change that.

25
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.050
We got to find my cricket, grandpa.

26
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.760
You've got to do it by sunrise.

27
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.180
What happens at sunrise?

28
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.570
You'll be stuck here forever.

29
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.240
Brad Oh.

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.180
I'm a big fan.

31
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.650
Never forget how much your family loves
your.

32
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.310
One cannot deny what is meant to be.

33
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
So I am terribly allergic to it that it
doesn't have any hair and I don't have a

34
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.550
nose. And yet here we are.
