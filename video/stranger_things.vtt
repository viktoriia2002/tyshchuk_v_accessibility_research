00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.670
Something is coming, something hungry.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.690
What is in the going deep shit?

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.290
I have to go later.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.450
See you tomorrow. Night, ladies, history on
that for me.

5
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.960
Well, first, well, is missing, I don't know
where he is.

6
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.860
Ninety nine out of 100 times kid goes
missing.

7
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.530
The kid is with a parent or relative.

8
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.760
What about the other time?

9
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.380
But you said 99 out of 100.

10
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.070
What about the other time? The one.

11
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.090
The one. Guys, I really think we should turn
back.

12
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.100
You're sure that.

13
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.070
That's not Will. You're in trouble, aren't
you?

14
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.650
We've sealed off this area is where it came
from.

15
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.380
Yes, and the girl.

16
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.930
She can't have gone far.

17
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.560
Five, three. You really think it was a
coincidence that we found the same place

18
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.270
Where will disappear? Something is going on
here.

19
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.900
Is there any way that you could reach him?

20
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.150
Yes. What if this whole time I've been
looking for Will?

21
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.040
She sniffed something else.
